    (Reported by Rudolf Mühlbauer.)


- Password Gorilla 1.3 (January 12, 2006)
  - Bugfix: fix compatibility with Password Safe 2.14 and later.
    (Fixes "V1 name field looks suspect" error.)
  - Bugfix: disable the menu when locked (in idle timeout), which
    on the Mac is not affected by a grab for all events by the
    unlock dialog.


- Password Gorilla 1.2 (June 26, 2005)
  - Added idle timeout (see Manage->Database Preferences).
  - Added auto-save.
  - Revised the exit dialog, if the database was modified. Instead of
    asking whether to discard changes, it now asks whether to save the
    modified database before exiting.
  - Show percentage indicator when loading or saving a database.
  - Added --rc <name> command-line option to use this configuration
    file instead of ~/.gorillarc or the Registry.
  - Bugfix: allow "\t" as a field separator for exporting.
  - Bugfix: get confirmation when opening a new database, and the
    current one is modified.
  - Bugfix: on Windows, show the Windows (native) path name of the
    database, i.e., using backslashes instead of slashes.


- Password Gorilla 1.1 (April 23, 2005)
  - Added "Export" feature (in the "File" menu) to export the database
    to a plain-text file (e.g., for backup purposes).
  - Added "Backup database on save" preference. If enabled, a backup
    copy will be created with the ".bak" extension.
  - Consider password database changed if the master password has
    changed -- and thus enable the "Save" menu item.
  - Bugfix when using non-Latin character sets.
  - For the Windows executable, add codeset pages for non-Latin
    input.
  - Added "-norc" command-line option. If used, default preferences
    are used, and no preferences will be loaded or written to a
    preferences file (Unix, Mac OS X) or the registry (Windows).
    The option can also be made part of the executable name, e.g.,
    "gorilla-norc.exe".


- Password Gorilla 1.0 (January 15, 2005)
  - Added Password Gorilla artwork; contributed by Andrew J. Sniezek.
  - Enabled mouse wheel on Windows.
  - Unicode support: Encode all strings using UTF-8, so that a
    database file may be moved between locales. If enabled, non-ASCII
    characters may not show up correctly when loading the database
    into Password Safe. If disabled, non-ASCII characters may not show
    up correctly when opening the database in a different locale.
  - Added dialog for database-specific preferences. So far, the only
    configurable preference is "Unicode support".
  - Merging a database now prompts whether the user wants to see a
    detailed report of the merged logins (conflicts, added logins,
    identical logins).
  - Bug fix: "Edit->Copy Password" now indeed copies the password to
    the clipboard, instead of the user name.
  - Effect the "Remember sizes of dialog boxes" only if the version
    number has not changed, as the size of dialog boxes may change
    between versions.


- Password Gorilla 1.0b1 (December 17, 2004)
  - Added "Credits" section to "Help->About" dialog.
  - Fix problem on Windows, when the Page Up and Page Down keys would
    scroll by two pages, when viewing the Help or License files.
  - Assign and update "Created", "Last Modified" and "Password Last
    Changed" timestamps; the latter two are shown in the Entry dialog.
  - In the tree view, arrange all groups before the entries.
  - Add "File->Preferences" dialog to configure, for now, the size
    of the last recently used databases list, a delay for clearing
    the clipboard, what action to take when double-clicking an entry,
    and whether to save information about dialog box sizes.
  - Provide some useful information in the bottom "status" line.
    Clear the status line after 5 seconds, so that potentially
    sensible information like "Password copied to clipboard" does
    not show forever.
  - Added option to clear the clipboard after a configurable amount
    of time (see Preferences above), so that passwords don't remain
    in the clipboard forever.
  - Implemented "Merge" functionality, to merge entries from a
    second database into the currently-open database. Duplicate
    entries are ignored, if they are identical. Otherwise, they
    will show up with the timestamp of their last modification.
  - On the Macintosh, use the ~/Library/Preferences/gorilla.rc file
    to store preferences.
  - Rename "entry" to "login".

  - Repackaged as Starkit and Starpack, to offer a binary download
    on Windows.
