title: Risks

Just like re-using the same passwords over and over again, or keeping
passwords written down on a sticker glued to the bottom of your desk,
some risks are associated with the use of Password Gorilla. This
section is not meant to scare you, but as an educated user, you have
the right to know about potential risks, and to make informed
decisions. Risks should not be ignored, but evaluated and addressed.

There are different threat vectors that can be considered:

 - [The Software Itself]
 - [System Failure]
 - [Other Users on a Shared Computer]
 - [Your System Administrator]
 - [Viruses, Backdoors, etc.]
 - [Putting Risk In Perspective]

-------------------
title: Starting

Upon start-up, Password Gorilla shows the ''Open Password Database''
dialog. It shows a list of recently used password database files,
allows you to browse for a different password database file, and asks
for the database's master password. Once a file is chosen, and the
master password is entered correctly, the password database is opened,
and its contents are shown.
   
To create a new, empty password database, click the ''New'' button on the ''Open Password Database'' dialog. You will be asked for an initial master password for the new password database.  Alternately a new database can be created by choosing the ''File'' menu and selecting ''New ...''.
   
-------------------
title: Choosing a Master Password

It goes without saying that the master password should be non-trivial.
I.e., the master password should not be a word in any language nor a
name. Such trivial passwords are subject to dictionary attacks, in
which an attacker could gain access to your master password by simply
using "brute force," by trying all the words in the dictionary.

Equally important is that the master password should not be kept in
the same place as the password database. Ideally, the master password
should not be written down at all, so that it remains in your personal
memory only. If you decide to write down your master password, keep it
away from your computer(s), in a location that only you know of.

Because the password database is encrypted using your master password
(using the peer-reviewed and commercially well-accpted Twofish
algorithm, for the technically inclined), it is imperative that you do
not forget your master password. It is impossible to recover a lost
master password. An encrypted password database can not be "cracked,"
as long as the master password is not trivial (see above).

Note that Password Gorilla does not try to second-guess your choice of
password. It does not check for or complain about passwords that would
generally be considered weak.

-------------------
title: Organization Into Groups

Logins in the password database are shown as a tree, organized into
nested groups. Groups allow you to arrange logins by category. Click
on the symbol next to a group's name (or double click the group
name) in order to view subgroups and logins that the group contains.

New groups and subgroups can be added by right-clicking on a group
name, and choosing the ''Add Subgroup'' option. (Macintosh users, hold
the Control key, and click on a group name.) In the dialog box that
opens, the "Parent Group" name will be set automatically, and the name
of the new subgroup can be entered.

Note that empty groups are not stored in the password database file.
If you save and re-open a file, empty groups will disappear.

-------------------
title: Logins

Groups can contain any number of logins. To add a new login,
right-click on a group, and choose the ''Add Login'' option. To edit an
existing login, right-click on a login, and select the ''Edit Login''
option. (Macintosh users, hold down the Control key, and click on a
group name.)

The following information is managed for each login:

'''Group'''

 | The name of the group to which this login belongs. The names of
hierarchical groups are concatenated, separated by a dot. A login can be
moved to a different group by editing this field.

'''Title'''

 | The login's title is shown in the main window, so that you can identify
the service that this login information belongs to, e.g., "E-Mail."

'''URL (V3 format only.)'''

 | The service's URL, if any. In the tree view, you can right-click on a
login and choose ''Copy URL to Clipboard'' in order to copy this data to the
clipboard, for pasting it into your browser's address bar. This field is
only available when using the "V3" database format; see the discussion of
the [V3] format below for more information.

'''Username'''

 | Your username for this service. In the tree view, you can right-click on
a login and choose ''Copy Username To Clipboard'' in order to copy this data
to the clipboard, for pasting it into the service's login prompt.

'''Password'''

 | The password that is associated with this login. In the tree view, you
can right-click on a login and choose ''Copy Password To Clipboard'' in order
to paste it into the service's password prompt.

'''Notes'''

 | You can use the notes field for arbitrary information that you wish to
associate with the login. E.g., you could note questions and answers to a
service's security questions (of the "What is your mother's maiden name?"
kind). Also, you can use the field for the service's URL. If the notes
include a string that starts with "http" or "https", or if they contain the
token "url:" followed by a URL (put the URL in quotes, if it contains
spaces), then you can right-click on an login and choose ''Copy URL To
Clipboard'' in order to paste the URL into your Web browser.

When editing a login, the password is not shown, for added protection
from curious onlookers. You can click the ''Show Password'' button to
toggle visibility of the password.

Clicking on ''Generate Password'' generates a new pseudo-random password
according to the current password policy (which is a per-database
setting that can be set using the ''Password Policy'' option in the
''Security'' menu). If the ''Override Password Policy'' box is checked, you
can edit the password policy to use for this one password.

The password policy allows you to set the length of randomly generated
passwords, and the characters to use. Check the "use easy to read
characters only" option to avoid characters that look similar. This
excludes the lower- and uppercase letters 'i', 'j', 'l' and 'o', the
digits '0' and '1', and the exclamation mark, pipe symbol, and
parentheses. Note: to generate random hexadecimal passwords, the "use
hexadecimal digits" option should be checked exclusively, and the
password length should be an even number.

The default password policy for the current database can be set using
the "Password Policy" dialog from the ''Manage'' menu.


-------------------
title: Preferences

General, database default and export preferences can be configured
using the ''Preferences'' dialog from the ''File'' menu. Database
preferences, which are specific to the current password database, can
be configured using ''Customize ...'' from the ''Security'' menu,
when a database is open.

-------------------
title: General Preferences

'''Clear clipboard after <nn> seconds'''

 | If this value is set to a non-zero value, the system clipboard is
cleared, the specified number of seconds after copying a user name, password
or URL to the clipboard. This ensures that no password remains in the
clipboard forever.

'''Remember <nn> database names'''
  
 | Makes Password Gorilla only remember the given number of most recently
used database file names. If set to zero, Password Gorilla will not remember
database file names at all. The current list of file names in the most
recently used list can be cleared with the button next to this option.

'''When double clicking a login'''
  
 | Configures what to do when you double-click on a login. The options are
to copy the login's password to the clipboard, to open the login for
editing, or to do neither.

'''Backup database on save'''

 | If enabled, then a backup file of the password database is made whenever
the database is saved. The backup file has the same name as the database
itself, but with the ".bak" extension.

'''Remember sizes of dialog boxes'''

 | Password Gorilla allows you to resize its main window, and most of its
dialogs, should you find the default sizes inconvenient. If this option is
enabled, Password Gorilla will remember the size of dialog boxes across
restarts.

-------------------
title: Database Default Preferences

Database default preferences are applied to new databases, but do not
affect existing databases. To change a setting for an existing
database, go to ''Customize'' in the ''Security'' menu. See the
discussion of [Database Preferences] below.

-------------------
title: Export Preferences

Export preferences apply to the exporting of a password database to a
plain-text file.

'''Include password field'''

 | If enabled, the password is included in the exported file. If disabled,
"********" is substituted for the password.

'''Include "Notes" field'''

 | If enabled, the "Notes" are included in the exported file.

'''Field separator'''

 | Configures the character to separate fields. This character should not
appear in any user name or password. Common separators are ":" (colon) and
"," (comma).

'''Show security warning'''

 | If enabled, reminds the user, before exporting the database, that the
exported plain-text file is not encrypted or password protected.

-------------------
title: Database Preferences

These database preferences can be configured using ''Customize'' from the
''Security'' menu.

'''Lock when idle after <nn> minutes'''

 | If this preference is set to a non-zero value, Password Gorilla will lock
the database after a period of inactivity. In that case, a dialog box opens,
prompting for the database's master password. The dialog also allows to exit
Password Gorilla. Note that this allows a malicious user to exit the
application, discarding changes. However, this is not a security issue: a
malicious user, having access to your desktop, could just as well kill the
application (e.g., from the console or the the Task Manager). A better
choice is to lock your desktop while unattended.

'''Auto-save database immediately when changed'''

 | If enabled, then the database will automatically be saved after each
change.

'''Use Password Safe 3 format'''

 | If this option is enabled (i.e., checked), the password database, when
saved, will use the new "Password Safe 3" encryption format. The database
will be compatible with Password Safe 3, but will not be compatible with
versions of Password Safe prior to 3.0, or versions of Password Gorilla
prior to 1.4. If this option is disabled (i.e., not checked), the old
Password Safe 2 database format is used: the database will be compatible
with Password Safe 2.0 or higher, and Password Gorilla 1.0 or higher.

 | It is highly recommended to enable this option, and to upgrade existing
databases to the Password Safe 3 format, which features enhanced security.
See below, Information about the new Database Format, for more information.

'''V2 Unicode support'''

 | Whether the database file uses Unicode. This is the default for the
Password Safe 3 format; this option only applies if the "Use Password Safe 3
format" option is disabled (i.e., not checked). If this option is enabled,
database files containing international characters can safely be exchanged
across locales, e.g., when you want to use the same password database in
both a Western European and Russian locale. The caveat is that, if you use
both Password Gorilla and Password Safe, the latter will not read accented
characters correctly. (The database will open, but non-ASCII characters will
not show up correctly.) This option has no effect if your database uses only
ASCII characters.

'''V3 key stretching iterations'''

 | The Password Safe 3 format supports "variable key stretching", which is a
means of protecting a database against brute-force attacks. Key stretching
is a complex operation that must be performed when validating a master
password for correctness. When an authorized user enters the correct
password, this may take a second and is barely noticeable. But it slows down
mass-testing password guesses by an automated program. The "iterations"
parameter indicates the complexity of the key stretching: the higher this
value, the longer it takes to open a database, and the longer it takes an
attacker to test one password. It is recommended to leave the value at its
default of 2048, which is a good compromise between promptly opening
databases and hampering attackers.

 | Note that this option can only be changed on a per-database basis and
does not appear in the Database Default Preferences Menu. This prevents a
malicious user from changing the preference in the registry and degrading
the protection of future databases.
          
-------------------
title: Display

'''Language'''

The menubutton Language offers you all the languages whose dictionary
files *.msg are found in the subdirectory msgs. Your choice will be
saved on exiting in the rc-file and the next time you start Gorilla it
is showing the prefered language.

'''Size'''

 | Choose the font size which shows the best results on your monitor.

'''Show Gorilla Icon'''

 | If you like the gorilla icon then check the button. The next time it will
greet you.

'''Iconify upon auto-lock'''

 | If this option is selected then Password Gorilla will also
iconify/minimize its windows when the lock after idle timer (see [Database
Preferences]) expires.

-------------------
title: Keyboard Shortcuts

'''Menu shortcuts'''

The Meta key for Linux and Windows shortcuts is the ''Control'' key, whereas the Mac uses the ''Command'' key:

-------------------
title: Information about the "V3" Database Format
alias: V3

'''"V3" Format Introduction'''

Password Gorilla 1.4 added support for a new encrypted format for
password databases, as introduced by version 3 of Password Safe --
therefore also called the "V3" format. This new format is based on the
years of experience with and analysis of the prior "V2" database
format, and features enhanced security (see below, V2 Format
Weakness for details). The new format offers:

 * Support for non-ASCII character sets by default.
 * A stand-alone field for a URL.
 * A checksum to detect tampering or truncation.
 * Use of the improved Twofish encryption algorithm.
 * Stronger protection against brute-force attacks on the master password.

It is recommended to use the new format, and to upgrade existing
password databases, unless you require compatibility with software
that supports the old format only, such as Password Safe 2.x, or
versions of Password Gorilla prior to 1.4.

'''Switching between the V2 and V3 Formats'''

Password Gorilla defaults to the V3 format for newly created
databases, but it does not automatically upgrade existing V2
databases. Upgrading, as well as downgrading, a database is
accomplished by enabling the Use Password Safe 3 format checkbox in
the Database Preferences menu (see above).

Password Safe recommends to use the ".psafe3" extension for V3-format
database files, and the ".dat" extension for V2-format files.
(Password Gorilla allows password database files in either format to
have any extension.)

'''V2 Format Weakness'''

In the interest of full disclosure, it should be noted that a
potential weakness was discovered with the old Password Safe 2 ("V2")
file format. This issue affected the "key stretching" process that is
intended to slow down a brute force attack against a database's master
password (i.e., repeated attempts at guessing the password). The
weakness in the file format's design allowed brute force attacks 1000
times faster than intended. The number sounds worse than it is: a
good, long master password is one among billions of billions of
combinations, and a factor of 1000 does not make a practical
difference. However, the factor may have an impact on the security of
password databases that use a short, more easily guessable master
password. The Password Safe 3 format avoids this issue by depending on
the result of the key stretching operation (which is computationally
expensive) as an input to decryption -- therefore, the operation can
not be bypassed.
   
-------------------
title: The Software Itself

First of all, the software itself may be a risk. For all you know, the
software's author could be a sociopath who tries to talk you into
downloading and installing buggy software that secretly broadcasts
your passwords. If you want, you can trust the author, third-party
recommendations, you can inspect the source code for trap doors, or
trust a third-party code inspection.

Maybe the software is not bug-free. In an extreme scenario, a bug in
Password Gorilla could destroy your password database. It is good
advice to keep a backup copy of your password database in a safe
place.

-------------------
title: System Failure

Sometimes, computers have the annoying habit to crash at the most
unfortunate time. Many users have lost data due to an unpredicted
crash. This can be problematic, e.g., when you just added or modified
a login, and did not get around to saving the updated password
database. If a password was randomly generated, it may be lost.

The easy workaround is to not confirm your password with the online
service before saving the password database. I.e., when creating a new
login, first add it in Password Gorilla, and immediately save the
database (using "Save" from the "File" menu). Only then go to your
online service -- e.g., the Web site that required registration, and
complete its signup process. When modifying a login, e.g., changing
the password, there is a chance that the computer might crash after
saving the database, but before completing the service's password
change process. In this case, the old password will still be available
in the password database's backup file -- assuming that you have a
backup copy, of course.


-------------------
title: Other Users on a Shared Computer

Common sense will go a long way in protecting your password database
from other users that you share a computer with. Never keep Password
Gorilla running when you leave the desktop unlocked. Make sure that
the database file is not readable by other users -- while the database
format is considered secure, this prevents other users from copying
the file, and making a brute-force attempt of guessing the master
password offline.

If you follow these precautions, there is nothing to worry about here.

-------------------
title: Your System Administrator

If your computer is administered by somebody else than you, then you
need to trust the administrator(s). An administrator can bypass the
operating system's security measures, and inspect a running program's
in-memory data. Password Gorilla obviously needs to have the decrypted
contents of your password database in memory, so a malicious
administrator could access Password Gorilla's memory, and gain access
to your passwords. In an attempt to foil naive attackers, Password
Gorilla takes some care by not storing data in clear text, but
encrypted using a temporary key. However, because the key is also kept
in memory by necessity, a motivated attacker could find both the
encrypted password and its key.

Of course, malicious administrators have a wide range of tools at
their disposal that invade on your privacy, in order to gain access to
your passwords. An administrator could replace the Password Gorilla
software with a trojan version that looks and acts the same, but sends
your passwords to the administrator's account. Even if you are not
using Password Gorilla, the administrator could install a key logger,
or monitor your internet connection, to find passwords as you type
them.

The added risk of using Password Gorilla is that a malicious
administrator could compromise all passwords at once, instead of only
intercepting the few passwords that you actually use and transmit in
one session.

-------------------
title: Viruses, Backdoors, etc.

If your computer is infected by spyware or viruses, then external
malicious users may have control over your computer. Such users could
use the same attacks as described for a system administrator above. It
is a good idea to check for viruses and spyware on a regular basis.
Password Gorilla should obviously not be used on a compromised
computer.

-------------------
title: Putting Risk In Perspective

The above does not necessarily imply that Password Gorilla is too
unsecure to use. They are merely a set of risks that need to be
considered and evaluated in order to make an informed decision, and to
take some common sense precautions. The author believes that using
Password Gorilla is a better idea than the alternative of writing down
passwords, or of reusing passwords.

As the example of the malicious system administrator shows, there is a
wide range of attacks that are possible even if you were not using
Password Gorilla.

Saying that Password Gorilla should not be used on a computer that is
infected with spyware, viruses, or backdoors, is good advice, but
redundant, as the problem is not limited to Password Gorilla. A
compromised computer should not be used for anything, especially not
for private communication.

Also, while technical attacks receive a lot of publicity, it should
not be forgotten that social engineering attacks are usually more
effective. In a study that I read about, a sizeable fraction of users
revealed their passwords to strangers on the street, for a mere piece
of chocolate. In one of the Hollywood movies that treat this subject
better than others, War Games, the protagonist gains access not by
pressing a magic button, or by bypassing security, but by spending
countless hours trying to get into the designer's mind, in a social
engineering attack to guess the designer's most likely choice of
password -- another reason to prefer random passwords.
