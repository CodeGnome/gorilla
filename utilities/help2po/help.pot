"Upon start-up, Password Gorilla shows the ''Open Password Database'' dialog. "
"It shows a list of recently used password database files, allows you to "
"browse for a different password database file, and asks for the database's "
"master password. Once a file is chosen, and the master password is entered "
"correctly, the password database is opened, and its contents are shown."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a new, empty password database, click the ''New'' button on the "
"''Open Password Database'' dialog. You will be asked for an initial master "
"password for the new password database.  Alternately a new database can be "
"created by choosing the ''File'' menu and selecting ''New ...''."
msgstr ""

msgid "   "
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It goes without saying that the master password should be non-trivial. I.e., "
"the master password should not be a word in any language nor a name. Such "
"trivial passwords are subject to dictionary attacks, in which an attacker "
"could gain access to your master password by simply using ''brute force,'' "
"by trying all the words in the dictionary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Equally important is that the master password should not be kept in the same "
"place as the password database. Ideally, the master password should not be "
"written down at all, so that it remains in your personal memory only. If you "
"decide to write down your master password, keep it away from your computer"
"(s), in a location that only you know of."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because the password database is encrypted using your master password (using "
"the peer-reviewed and commercially well-accepted Twofish algorithm, for the "
"technically inclined), it is imperative that you do not forget your master "
"password. It is impossible to recover a lost master password. An encrypted "
"password database can not be \"cracked,\" as long as the master password is "
"not trivial (see above)."

"1) The Login menu contains commands \"Move Login ...\" and \"Move Group ..."

"2) In the right-click menu that appears from right-clicking a login or group "

"groups in the database.  Selecting one of the current group names will cause "
"the right-clicked login to be moved to the selected group."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"3) A set of groups or logins can be selected by clicking with the left mouse "
"button.  Use shift plus click or control plus click to select multiple "
"items.  If the button is held down and the mouse is moved a short distance, "
"a drag and drop operation will begin.  When this happens the cursor will "
"change to a double vertical arrow and a floating window will appear showing "
"the title of the item(s) being dragged.  As the item(s) are being dragged "
"the active drop location will be highlighted in the tree and will correspond "
"to the tree item that is underneath the cursor.  Drop the item by releasing "
"the mouse button with the cursor located above a line in the tree."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Dropping a login or a group onto a login name will perform a move to the "
"group location where the drop occurred.  Dropping a login or a group onto a "
"group name will perform a move into the group where the drop occurred."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"4) Within the edit login dialog the entry for group name for the login is "
"also a drop down select list containing all current group names.  To move a "
"login to a new group while editing, either type a new group into the group "

"The Password Safe 3 format supports ''variable key stretching'', which is a "

"Key stretching is a complex operation that must be performed when validating "
"a master password for correctness.  When an authorized user enters the "
"correct password, this may take a second and is barely noticeable.  But it "
"slows down mass-testing password guesses by an automated program.  The "
"''iterations'' parameter indicates the complexity of the key stretching: the "
"higher this value, the longer it takes to open a database, and the longer it "
"takes an attacker to test one password."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The correct choice for this value depends upon several factors, one of which "
"is the expected computational performance that an attacker may utilize "
"against any given password database file.  It should be chosen such that an "
"attacker can only test a few password possibilities per second instead of "
"testing millions or billions of possibilities per second.  A rule of thumb "
"is to pick a value such that it takes Gorilla about 1-2 seconds during the "
"\"Please be patient. Verifying password ...\" phase of opening a database. "
"The value can range from a low of 2,048 to a high of 2,147,483,647.  Use "
"care in searching for a reasonable value, setting too large a value "
"initially will create a password safe file which can take a very long time "
"to open later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this option can only be changed on a per-database basis and does "

msgid "'''Automatic iteration calculation'''"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section allows for automatic calculation of an iteration value that "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the computation of the value occurs by measuring the time delay "
"for a small iteration count and then scaling that count by the requested "
"length of time.  As a result the actual computed value will depend upon "
"several factors out of Gorilla's control, including the CPU load level when "
"the calculate button is depressed.  The computed value should be close to "

msgid "'''V2 Format Weakness'''"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the interest of full disclosure, it should be noted that a potential "
"weakness was discovered with the old Password Safe 2 (''V2'') file format. "
"This issue affected the ''key stretching'' process that is intended to slow "
"down a brute force attack against a database's master password (i.e., "
"repeated attempts at guessing the password). The weakness in the file "
"format's design allowed brute force attacks 1000 times faster than intended. "
"The number sounds worse than it is: a good, long master password is one "
"among billions of billions of combinations, and a factor of 1000 does not "
"make a practical difference. However, the factor may have an impact on the "
"security of password databases that use a short, more easily guessable "
"master password. The Password Safe 3 format avoids this issue by depending "
"on the result of the key stretching operation (which is computationally "
"expensive) as an input to decryption -- therefore, the operation can not be "
"bypassed."
